# My Vocal Buddy 
My Vocal Buddy is a mobile app which use speech recognition and machine learning to detect stuttered speech from voice. Once trained, it can predict the stutter type of a person and based on that the system will give specific tutorials to the user. It will also provide the user to track their progress by giving them a score and ask them to do a speech test again.
Overall, the purpose of this app is to identify the stuttering and helps to reduce the stuttering level of the person. We wanted to make their lives, who face the same problem easier and this can be used as an additional support along with Speech therapist guidance.
